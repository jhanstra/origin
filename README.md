# Origin

**A collection of starting templates and boilerplate code for types of apps I build. Origin is opinionated and based on what I like, but feel free to fork and delete and add whatever you like. Origin provides an initial scaffold from which to build any new app.**

### Why?
Whenever I start a project, I'm overwhelmed by the prospect of setting up all of the initial configuration. Installing all the packages I need, scaffolding everything out, getting organized, figuring out my build set-up, testing framework, utility libraries, deployment strategy, linting, hot reloading, etc. These are all things that are necessary for every app, so getting them all done in as little time as possible is very valuable.s

### Work in Progress
The goal of this project is to continually evolve based on best practices and new technologies, frameworks, and libraries that I like. It is intended to be a solid foundation on which to build any application, with examples of how things work in that type of application.

## What's Included

#### Javascript

**ESLint**: templates are linted using [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) according to the [Standard JS](https://standardjs.com/) conventions
**Babel**: templates use Babel to compile modern JS language features down to compatible features. We use [ES-2015](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-es2015/) and [Stage 2](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-stage-2/) presets
**NPM scripts**: relatively simple apps use npm scripts for most build steps unless webpack is needed.
**Package.json**: package.json is included with all the packages needed for the app. All that's needed is an `npm install`
**Gitignore**: a gitignore file specialized for the type of app
**EditorConfig**: a config file to tell your editor how to format code
